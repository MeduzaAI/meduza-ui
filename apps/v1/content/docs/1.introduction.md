# Introduction

Welcome to Meduza UI - a modern Vue.js component library that brings beautiful, accessible components to your projects with the simplicity of copy-and-paste. Inspired by the shadcn/ui philosophy, Meduza UI provides you with the source code, not just pre-built packages.

## What is Meduza UI?

Meduza UI is a collection of reusable Vue.js components built with:

- **SCSS Styling** - Comprehensive design system with CSS custom properties
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and excellent developer experience
- **Vue 3 Composition API** - Modern, reactive component architecture
- **Accessibility First** - WCAG compliant components out of the box
- **Copy & Paste** - Own your components, modify as needed

Unlike traditional UI libraries, Meduza UI doesn't lock you into a specific design system. You get the source code and can customize it to match your brand perfectly.

## Philosophy

### You Own Your Components

When you add a Meduza UI component to your project, you're not installing a dependency - you're copying the source code directly into your codebase. This means:

- **Full Control** - Modify components to fit your exact needs
- **No Breaking Changes** - Component updates don't break your app
- **Bundle Optimization** - Only include what you use
- **Easy Customization** - Change styles, behavior, and structure freely

### Built for Developers

Meduza UI is designed with developer experience in mind:

- **TypeScript First** - Components are built with TypeScript from the ground up
- **BEM Methodology** - Consistent, maintainable CSS class naming
- **Modern Tooling** - Works seamlessly with Vite, Nuxt, and Vue CLI
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Every component includes examples and API references

## How It Works

Meduza UI uses a simple CLI tool to copy components directly into your project:

```bash
# Initialize your project
npx meduza-ui init

# Add components as needed
npx meduza-ui add button
npx meduza-ui add card dialog
```

The CLI will:

1. **Setup** - Configure your project with the base style system
2. **Install** - Copy component files to your codebase
3. **Configure** - Update your import paths and dependencies

Once installed, components are yours to modify, extend, and maintain.
